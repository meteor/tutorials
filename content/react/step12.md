# What's next?

Congratulations on your newly built Meteor app!

Your app currently supports collaborating on a single todo list. To see how you
could add more functionality, check out the Todos example&mdash;a more
complete app that can handle sharing multiple lists. Also, try Local Market, a
cross-platform customer engagement app that shows off native hardware
functionality and social features.

```bash
meteor create --example todos
meteor create --example localmarket
meteor create --react new-react-app
```
