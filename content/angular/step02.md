# Defining views with templates

To use Angular in our app, we first need to remove the default UI package of Meteor, called `Blaze`.

We remove it by running:

    meteor remove blaze-html-templates

Now we need to replace it with UI package for angular:

    meteor add angular-templates

To start working with [angular-meteor](http://angular-meteor.com/), let's add some NPM packages.

    meteor npm install --save angular angular-meteor

> Note: `meteor npm` supports the same features as `npm`, though the difference can be important.  Consult the [`meteor npm` documentation](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteornpm) for more information.

To start working on our todos list app, let's replace the code of the default starter app with the code below. Then we'll talk about what it does.

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-angular" step="2.2"}}

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-angular" step="2.3"}}

Let's create a template for todosList component.

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-angular" step="2.4"}}

Add some functionality:

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-angular" step="2.5"}}

We can now implement it into the application.

First, we have to put component into a template:

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-angular" step="2.6"}}

Then add module to the application:

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-angular" step="2.7"}}

In our browser, the app should look pretty much like this:

> #### Todo List
> - This is task 1
> - This is task 2
> - This is task 3

Now let's find out what all these bits of code are doing!

### HTML files in Meteor define templates

Meteor parses all of the regular .HTML files in your app folder and identifies three top-level tags: **&lt;head>**, **&lt;body>**, and **&lt;template>**.

Everything inside any &lt;head> tags is added to the `head` section of the HTML sent to the client, and everything inside &lt;body> tags is added to the `body` section, just like in a regular HTML file.

The [angular-meteor package](http://angular-meteor.com/) parses all of the `html` files in your app folder and puts them in Angular's template cache with the id of their full path.

So, for example, when a file named `my-angular-template.html` is placed in the `client` folder, it will be available for `ng-include` or `ui-router` with the name `client/my-angular-template.html`.

### Adding logic and data to templates

All of the code in your `html` files is compiled with Angular. Angular binds the data into our templates just like any other Angular app.

In the next step, we will see how we can use the $meteor service to bind our scope data to a database collection.
