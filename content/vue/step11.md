# Testing

Now that we've created a few features for our application, let's add a test to ensure that we don't regress and that it works the way we expect.

We'll write a test that exercises one of our Methods (which form the "write" part of our app's API), and verifies it works correctly.

To do so, we'll add a [test driver](http://guide.meteor.com/testing.html#test-driver) for the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) JavaScript test framework, along with a test assertion library:

```bash
meteor add meteortesting:mocha
meteor npm install --save-dev chai
```

We can now run our app in "test mode" by calling out a special command and specifying to use the driver (you'll need to stop the regular app from running, or specify an alternate port with `--port XYZ`):

```bash
TEST_WATCH=1 meteor test --driver-package meteortesting:mocha
```

If you do so, you should see a `0 passing` message in your console window.

Let's add a simple test (that doesn't do anything yet):

In any test we need to ensure the database is in the state we expect before beginning. We can use Mocha's `beforeEach` construct to do that easily:

{{> DiffBox tutorialName="simple-todos-react" step="11.3"}}

Here we create a single task that's associated with a random `userId` that'll be different for each test run.

Now we can write the test to call the `tasks.remove` method "as" that user and verify the task is deleted:

There's a lot more you can do in a Meteor test! You can read more about it in the Meteor Guide [article on testing](http://guide.meteor.com/testing.html).
